				During the War of Independence, Zuazo's bridge was a key structure to prevent the advance of French's army, which sieged Isla de Leon using 20,000 men during 2 yeas and a half. The bridge had the most numerous batteries which defended the last unconquered place of the peninsula. In 1812 it blown up to definitively prevent French advance, which eventually retreated due the inability of crossing the bridge.

				Bastion placed in the outskirts of Cadiz City, at the far side of La Caleta beach, on a small islet which could only be accessed during low tides. From there all ships entering the bay could be watched.

				In 1457, a Venetian ship affected by the plague sought shelter in the islet and rebuilt the tower along with a shrine to San Sebastian.

				Afterwards the Anglo-Dutch ransacking in 1596, it was decided to use the islet as a castle, fully rebuilding the tower in 1613 and providing it artillery while being also used as a lighthouse.
                
				In 1706, a construction of the castle to defend the north side of the city was begun.

                In 1739, the castle had 17 cannons that controlled entrance of La Caleta and the south bay access.

				San Catalina's castle is one of Cadiz's stronghold placed on the northernmost end of La Caleta beach, which is offshore thanks to its breakwaters.
				
				It was constructed in April 1598 by the engineer Cristobal de Rojas, because of the tragic ransacking two years ago by the Anglo-Dutch troops. This was possible due the poor defences that the city had back then, so Felipe II ordered to reinforce Cadiz, and thus Cristobal de Rojas' project initiated.
				
                A chapel and a sacristy was build during Carlos II reign in 1693. That chapel was consecrated to San Catalina de Alejandria and to the Immaculate Conception.

				Charles III transformed it in a military prison for distinguished personalities in 1769.

				Candelaria bastion was a stronghold that was part of the maritime defence front of Cadiz's bay and watched the north-eastern front of the city.
				
				It was constructed in 1672 at the initiative of governor Diego Caballero de Illescas to watch the natural entrance of Cadiz's dock, take advance of its elevated point position. It was protected by a hard wall which served as breakwater, and with it cannons dominated natural channel's access to the docks.
				
				It served as barracks, armourers and army's dovecote.

				In May of 1597, Felipe II ordered to build a stronghold in the narrow part of the bay as, until then, the bay was completely unguarded Matagorda's castle would be able to cross-fire bay's entrances and exists of ships. Until April of 1810, Matagorda's stronghold remained in Spanish possession.
				
				San Luis' stronghold was placed at the shores of Trocadero. Despite its previous existence, it was rebuilt thanks to some French soldiers in 1706, thanks to Spain and France's alliance during the War of the Spanish Succession. Its emplacement would allow it to hinder the advance of ships that somehow managed to enter the bay. The bad thing about it was its low and straight wall, which eventually couldn't withstand the might of the sea. The central square, rooms and storages ended up flooded during high tides because of its lowness, which also turned the stronghold in an island.
				
				Engineer Cristobal de Rojas started this project during 1607, but died before finish them. Juan Hurtado resumed his work when Cadiz was	threatened by the Dutch fleet.
				
				Before the arrival of French troops in 1810, both strongholds were destroyed in order to prevent being used to attack Cadiz.

				Sancti Petri's castle was built over an islet of the same name in front of el Caño's mouth.
				
				Historical references state that around 1100 b.c. a great temple was built on Sancti Petri's islet to worship Melkart. Later, a Roman temple to Hercules was build on its remains, which lasted until 4th century as it completely lost its greatness during Visigoth domain. From that moment it began disappearing due the attacks, its consecutive occupations, the motion of the sea and the working of quarries.
	
				During 13th century was used as a lighthouse and a small stronghold. During the five next centuries, the stronghold is converted into a castle and several facilities were built, as walls, towers, armoured forts... The structure reaches its final form sometime in-between 18th and 19th century.
	
				This final shape was the one shown during the Napoleonic siege of Cadiz's islands during 1810 and 1812 as a defensive bastion and against pirates incursions. It was heavily bombarded by French troops during the War of Independence. It had 28 artillery pieces, making it (supported by the nearby land batteries of Punta de Boqueron) an almost insurmountable bastion.
